Simple web application to allow reporting of course conditions at my golf club.

Scalable UI with giant buttons to make it super easy to use on smartphones and tablets.

Exposes the data as a simple table view, an embeddable `iframe`, and an Atom feed for posting to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lenziegolfclub) using [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/).
